# qt-av-powerful-media-player

It is an example from [Qt-AV project](https://github.com/wang-bin/QtAV).

## Because it has no ads and anyone is free to use it, so I build this example and deploy it to be a green version.

Once you have downloaded it, you can immediately use it to play almost all of the video and audio formats.
